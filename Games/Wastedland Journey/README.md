# Game Wastedland Journey
Inspired by Fallout 4 & Fallout Shelter

Aubrey recently are playing PS4 Fallout 4 although he's sucks in playing shooting games, but he's very interested on another game Fallout Shelter, enjoying the progress of sending people to wastedland to fight with enemy automatically.

So during his progress of learnig Python, we're work together to make this simple game.
